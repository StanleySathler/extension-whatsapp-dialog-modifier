# WhatsApp Dialog Modifier
This tiny Chrome extension allows you to modify your conversations on WhatsApp and have fun with that. Shall I say that only you can see these changes? :)

_This extension is still in progress, but you should not wait many features from that. It's a funny toy, to make some jokes with your friends. This is not gonna be a new startup._

## How can I install?
This extension is not packed yet, so you must install it as an unpacked extension. Don't worry, it is easy. [Learn how to do it](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).

## How can I use it?
After installed, you'll see a WhatsApp icon in your extensions icons (top right corner in your Chrome). So, follow these steps:
1. Go to https://web.whatsapp.com
2. Open a conversation with any of your contacts
3. Click on the extension icon, on the top right corner
4. Click on any message (from you or from your contact) and edit it
